> In general, semantic html-markup like `<nav>` does not require attributes for usability. There will be cases in which you will need to selectively "show" and "hide" content by either removing it from the visual flow or preventing screen readers from reading it.

| Scenario | Solution |
| --- | --- |
| Hide from everyone | Add the boolean hidden attribute attribute to dynamically hide content from all users. Remove the attribute to show it again. |
| Hide from screen readers only | Use the `aria-hidden="true"` attribute to hide content from screen readers while keeping it visually perceivable. |
| Hide from browsers only | Use the `.nrk-sr` class to show content to screen readers only. The content is visually hidden but remains visible for screen readers. |
| Hide but show on focus | Use the `.nrk-sr-focus` class to show content only when in focus. This is practical in keyboard-only interactions such as "skip to content". |
